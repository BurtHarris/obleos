# obleos - experimental knowledge exchange language

## Background

This project is inspired by many progenetors,
JSON, Yaml, TypeScript, CBOR and others deserve credit for many of the ideas.   The project's name comes from its use of certain Unicode code points as sigils (_magic_ characters) that seem to come from Roman editing of Greek texts.

The Obleos toolset is intended to allow a (sometimes lossy)transformoration of text into both JSON and CBOR representations.
