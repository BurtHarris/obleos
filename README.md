The project's name comes from its use of certain Unicode code points as sigils (_magic_ characters) that seem to come from Roman editing of Greek texts.  Some Obleos sigils under consideration include:
## Block sigils
- __`⁒`__ Obleos directive sigil (`%` may work under limited conditions)
- __`⁜`__ the dotted cross - potentially used for line comments, like `#` or `//` in other languages

## Background

This project is inspired by many progenetors, JSON, Yaml, TypeScript, CBOR and others deserve credit for many of the ideas.   

The Obleos toolset is intended to allow a (sometimes lossy) transformoration of text into both JSON and CBOR representations.
